A cookiecutter_ template for creating reusable Django packages (installable apps) quickly.

**Why?** Creating reusable Django packages has always been annoying. There are no defined/maintained
best practices (especially for ``setup.py``), so you end up cutting and pasting hacky, poorly understood,
often legacy code from one project to the other. This template, inspired by `cookiecutter-pypackage`_,
is designed to allow Django developers the ability to break free from cargo-cult configuration and follow
a common pattern dictated by the experts and maintained here.

.. _cookiecutter-pypackage: https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage

Features
--------

* Sane setup.py for easy PyPI registration/distribution
* Travis-CI configuration
* Codecov configuration
* Tox configuration
* Sphinx Documentation
* BSD licensed by default
* Basic model generation

Usage
-----

First, create your empty repo on Github (in our example below, we would call it ``blogging_for_humans``) and set up your virtual environment with your favorite method.

**Note**: Your project will be created with README.rst file containing a pypi badge, a travis-ci badge and a link to documentation on readthedocs.io. You don't need to have these accounts set up before using Cookiecutter or cookiecutter-djangopackage.

Now, get Cookiecutter_. Trust me, it's awesome::

    $ pip install cookiecutter

Now run it against this repo::

    $ cookiecutter gh:pydanny/cookiecutter-djangopackage

You'll be prompted for some questions, answer them, then it will create a directory that is your new package.

Let's pretend you want to create a reusable Django app called "Blogging-for-Humans", with an app that can be placed
in ``INSTALLED_APPS`` as "blogging_for_humans". Rather than have to copy/paste from other people's projects and
then fight enthusiasm-destroying app layout issues like `setup.py` configuration and creating test
harnesses, you get Cookiecutter_ to do all the work.

**Warning**: After this point, change 'Daniel Greenfeld', 'pydanny', etc to your own information.

It prompts you for information that it uses to create the app, with defaults in square brackets. Answer them::

    Choose from 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 [1]:

Enter the project and take a look around::

    $ cd blogging_for_humans/
    $ ls

Create a GitHub repo and push it there::

    $ git init
    $ git add .
    $ git commit -m "first awesome commit"
    $ git remote add origin git@github.com:pydanny/blogging_for_humans.git
    $ git push -u origin master

Now take a look at your repo. Awesome, right?

It's time to write the code!!!

Running Tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Code has been written, but does it actually work? Let's find out!

::

    source <YOURVIRTUALENV>/bin/activate
    (myenv) $ pip install -r requirements_test.txt
    (myenv) $ python runtests.py

Setting up Travis
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You will need to explicitly activate your repo in your `Travis CI profile`_.
If the repo isn't showing up, run a manual synchronisation.

.. _Travis CI profile: https://travis-ci.org/profile/

Integration with codecov.io
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Code coverage is integrated with `Codecov`_. Make sure you have an account
and that you've granted access to your repo. In case of a private repo, you
will need to generate a token and pass it when submitting coverage.

.. _CodeCov: https://codecov.io/

Register on PyPI
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once you've got at least a prototype working and tests running, it's time to register the app on PyPI::

    python setup.py register


Releasing on PyPI
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Time to release a new version? Easy!

First, use `bumpversion` to up the release number::

    $ pip install bumpversion
    $ bumpversion --current-version VERSION_NUMBER minor --config-file setup.cfg

Where `VERSION_NUMBER` is the current version, e.g. `0.1.0`.

Then run::

    $ python setup.py publish

It will answer with something like::

    You probably want to also tag the version now:
          git tag -a 0.1.0 -m 'version 0.1.0'
          git push --tags

Go ahead and follow those instructions.

Add to Django Packages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once you have a release, and assuming you have an account there,
just go to https://www.djangopackages.com/packages/add/ and add it there.

Follows Best Practices
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This project follows best practices as espoused in `Two Scoops of Django: Best Practices for Django 3.x`_.
